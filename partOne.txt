Monte Carlo Localization is an algorithm used by robots to find their location, 
given a map of the surroundings. It works by eliminating the places where the 
robot cannot be. 
The steps of the algorithm:
1. A set of hypothetical robots are created at random positions and random 
orientations in the map
2. The actual robot gathers data from its surroundings
3. Based off of the data, some hypothetical robots can be eliminated, as they could 
not be where the actual robot is.
4. Then, a new set of hypothetical robots are created, with those robots clustered around the remaining robots from the old set.
5. The steps 1-4 repeat until the majority of the hypothetical robots are at one position and orientation.

Note: in step two, data is gathered through observations. Should the robot move in 
one direction and make an observation, all the hypothetical subs will also move in 
that direction. Additionally, noise will be applied, resulting in a slight scattering 
of the hypothetical subs. Only after the shift in position will some of the hypothetical subs be eliminated.
