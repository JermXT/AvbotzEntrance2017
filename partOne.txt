Monte Carlo Localization is an algorithm used by robots to find their location, 
given a map of the surroundings. It works by eliminating the places where the 
robot cannot be. 
The steps of the algorithm:
1. A set of hypothetical robots are created at random positions in the map
2. The actual robot gathers data from its surroundings
3. Based off of the data, some hypothetical robots can be eliminated, as they could not be where the actual robot is.
4. Then, a new set of hypothetical robots are created, with those robots clustered around the remaining robots from the old set.
5. This process repeats until the majority of the hypothetical robots are at one position and orientation.
