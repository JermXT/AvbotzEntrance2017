Basically Monte Carlo Localization puts a bunch of randomly generated submarines 
with different orientations in the pool. Then, based off of the information 
gathered from the camera, the algorithm can estimate the possible locations for 
the submarine(i.e. if there are 3 buoys in front of the camera, the sub knows it 
is on one side of the buoys). The hypothetical submarines in the possible 
locations are then weighted greater than the ones that are not likely to be 
where the sub is. Then, a new bunch of submarines are generated, mostly next to 
the heavily weighted submarines. This process is repeated until the vast majority 
of the submarines have converged at one point with one orientation.
